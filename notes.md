- uses require because imports aren't ready yet, and don't work well with express (when transpiling with babel)
- uses uuid's instead of ObjectId's to avoid passing data in the id (ObjectId's include readable data about the server)
- Users, Lists, and Products are separate entites and are linked to each other using references (stored as unique id's). For example: 
  - User
    - email
    - password
    - lists
      - an array of unique list ID's that reference items of the "Lists" collection
- These relationships are managed using mongo's `ref` and `populate()`
